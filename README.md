Reusable components for building event-sourced architectures.

More or less related to https://github.com/function61/eventhorizon - application-specific
helpers, code generation etc. to make using event-sourced applications easier.

To better understand what this library offers, take a
[guided tour of Varasto's codebase](https://github.com/function61/varasto/blob/master/docs/design_codebase.md).

Might be integrated to EventHorizon later.
